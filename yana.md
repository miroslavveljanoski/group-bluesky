# About Yana

## Introduction

She comes from Indonesia. She speak fluently Indonesian and English, ik spreek ook een klein beetje Nederlands et j'essaie même de parler français mais c'est pas facile du tout!
She firstly came to Belgium to study and  recently finished her studies in Business Management at VUB in Brussels. But a litte bit before that, she worked in Bali for 2 years which was the best time of my life! ☺️
Now she lives in Boortmeerbeek (a small town in between Mechelen and Leuven), thus she's gonna see you once or twice at the train station.
